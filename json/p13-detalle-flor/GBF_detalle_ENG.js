Fray Bernardino de Sahagún placed special emphasis on highlighting the qualities of seduction and fascination of its fragrance, which \"is dense, it insinuates, embraces, continues embracing, surrounds,\" evoking the sensual dimension of flowers as a source of joy and pleasure, a facet also present in the complex and rich nature of the god Xochipilli. The union of all these qualities in the same flower could have made it one of the most valued species for its ties to the divine, stemming from its shape, loveliness, and aroma.</p><p>Sahagún also refers to it as \"tlazoizquixochitl\" and describes is as the \"white acuilloxochitl,\" and this same name appears in the <i>Codex De la Cruz-Badiano</i>, but there it seems to be a different species.</p><p>Today it is commonly known as jasmine flower and it continues to be appreciated from its aroma and beauty.</p>",

They are both evoked on the Xochipilli sculpture, because they share morphological characteristics and the capacity to alter human consciousness to differing degrees, an attribute tied to the divine in the Mesoamerica world.</p><p>Both families of flowers grow in temperate and tropical zones, beside paths and in milpas (corn fields), which relate them to the agricultural cycle; they can be found in sown fields from the start of the rainy season to October. They differ in that <i>ololiuhqui</i> grows like a creeper, whereas toloache grows erect.</p><p>Both plant groups have psychotropic and medicinal properties. It should be pointed out that the Nahuatl word <i>ololiuhqui</i> refers to the seed, while the name of the plant in general is <i>coaxoxouhqui</i>, \"blue serpent.\" Ingesting the pulverized seed can produce sensory alterations. As for its medicinal properties, multiple references appear in the <i>Florentine Codex</i>, in Durán’s <i>Historia</i>, and in Francisco Hernández’s <i>Historia natural</i>. The seed is applied as a topical remedy for gout. Also, ground up with <i>picietl</i> (tobacco), it has the \"strange virtue of causing faintness and dizziness which when applied as a poultice numbs flesh,\" and it also \"admirably [relieves] dislocated or broken bones and the relaxed waist of women, strengthening it.\" Other benefits of the rest of the plant are also mentioned; the ground bark relieves stomach ailments, pressure on the heart, and fever; the ground root works as a purgative.</p><p>As for <i>toloache</i>, it produces intense psychotropic effects. According to Sahagún it eliminates hunger and makes people \"perpetually perturbed and maddened.\"</p><p>Medicinal properties of <i>toloache</i> include relief from gout, swelling, fever, and chest pain when applied as a salve; it also mitigates deafness in the ears and induces drowsiness when its leaves are placed under the pillow.</p>",

			txt: "<p>In the Mesoamerican world mushrooms and plants that provoked altered states of consciousness and induced trances in ritual contexts, whether medical or religious, were highly prized and at times feared. Their sacred dimension for the Mexicas and even today for some indigenous peoples, resided in their power to establish communication with the gods and to put people on a metaphysical plane of existence. Their presence on Xochipilli, through the evocation of <i>ololiuhqui</i> and <i>toloache</i> flowers and vines, reinforces the importance of flowers in the Mexica world as divine matter controlling innumerable qualities, from the sensory and earthly such as aroma and beauty, to the sublime, as the path establishing dialogue with the divine.</p><p>Although Fray Bernardino de Sahagún emphasized the effects of <i>ololiuhqui</i> as negative, by warning that \"this seed perturbs and maddens... and those who consume them seem to see visions and terrifying things,\" Fray Diego Durán describes their sacred and ritual context by listing it as an ingredient in the \"wicked salve\" called <i>teotlacualli </i>or \"divine food\" that was rubbed on youths in the <i>telpochcalli</i>, the religious school for boys, in various ceremonial contexts. Likewise, Hernández states that \"the Indian priests, when they wished to simulate that they were speaking with the gods and received answers from them, they ate this plant to become delirious and see a thousand ghosts and figures of devils.\"</p><p><i>Ololiuhqui</i> seeds were also ingested by those who were to be sacrificed, right before their death, because they provoked a sensation of euphoria and then drowsiness, while buffering their perception of pain.</p><p>In the same ritual and ceremonial context, <i>ololiuhqui</i> flowers are also mentioned. Sahagún speaks or if as part of the group of \"precious, sweet-smelling and fragrant flowers\" that were offered to Huitzilopochtli on the day of his calendrical sign, One Flint, thus highlighting the importance of the flower and its aroma as something precious, worthy of being offered.</p>",

The variety consumed in different ways in the Basin of Mexico in the sixteenth century might have been imported from Oaxaca or from Veracruz. It was highly valued for its seeds and leaves, as well as its flowers.</p><p>In his account of medicinal herbs, Sahagún refers to tobacco as <i>picietl</i> and mentions its anti-inflammatory and invigorating properties, but he also warns that, if chewed, it intoxicates, causes dizziness, and kills the appetite. Durán, in turn, states it was mixed with lime to diminish its toxicity (<i>tenexyetl</i>), and he states that <i>picietl</i> \"is an herb that the Indians use to deaden the flesh to not feel work,\" referring to its everyday use. Hernández confirms this by saying it is \"a medicine so craved by all the Indians that the markets are filled with it.\" But what Hernández emphasizes the most are its multiple medicinal uses. The leaves when dried and smoked in reed tubes \"admirably provoke expectoration, they relieve asthma as if miraculously,\" and in other preparations they are used to treat countless ailments, ranging from muscle pain and uterine complications to dental cavities.</p><p>But speaking of its flowers, Sahagún devotes eloquent passages to diverse varieties of <i>yiexochitl</i> or tobacco flowers, mostly grown in gardens; he emphatically refers to its fragrant perfume and its pleasing quality. He describes it in special detail, evoking the almost contemplative work done \"by the art of craftspeople who make flowers,\" the flowering process of the <i>yiexochitl</i> when the buds \"become fat, swell, become large, burst, open, expand, and produce an aroma, a pleasing aroma.\" Even the smell is described as \"precious,\" something that comes for \"merit,\" that gives \"solace.\" Finally he tells of the <i>chalchiuhyiexochitl</i>, a variety green like jade, which is \"marvelous, admirable, desirable, always in demand, craved; useful, always useful.\"</p>",

			txt: "<p>The broad spectrum of the tobacco plant’s uses and meanings, together with its immense power, both divine and dangerous, earned it a primordial place among the substances of greatest value and tradition at all levels of Mexica society in all its cultural dimensions, from the most ordinary to the most sacred contexts. It could be acquired in outdoor markets as <i>tenexyetl</i> to relieve fatigue from daily physical labor or be flaunted on the belts of noblemen, doctors, or midwives, or serve as part of the ceremonial paraphernalia in temples in \"a medium-sized gourd... perforated with holes, and in each one of these had been placed a flower. It was also adorned with little balls of tobacco and soot; this gourd was called Iyetecon (his little gourd),\" according to Fray Diego Durán; or else for its seeds to be offered in the Templo Mayor (Great Temple) of Tenochtitlan, as borne out by archaeological finds. Tobacco was raised to divine status given its close relationship with deities such as Toci and Cihuacoatl.</p><p>Tobacco as a plant, with all its boons, sacred nature, and immense cultural importance for the Mexicas, is present as a flower on the Xochipilli sculpture. Its \"usefulness\" so passionately lauded by Sahagún perhaps symbolically brings to bear all the plant’s virtues. However, tobacco flowers take on the greatest significance as a symbol of preciousness, which in this particular case, are valued as a sign of \"merit\" and a source of \"solace,\" appealing more to the spirit’s innermost depths and of greater transcendence than the mere pleasure its aroma and beauty could arouse. In Sahagún’s account, yellow and blue varieties of <i>yiexochitl</i> were part of the group of \"precious flowers, sweet-smelling and fragrant\" offered to Huitzilopochtli on the day of his calendrical sign, One Flint, elevating the semantics of the fragrance from the sensory to the sacred. At the same time, in his account on the feast day <i>Uey Tecuilhuitl</i> dedicated to Xilonen, the young maize goddess, Sahagún points out how it was permitted for the first time in the year to smell \"the sweetness of the flowers, of the marigold, of the tobacco flower,\" in the same way that the first fruits of the harvest could be eaten. There the fragrance of these flowers becomes a metaphor for fertility and life in the ritual universe.</p><p>However, flowers as an aromatic offering were also food for the gods, as well as the symbol of song, with all its connotations of joy, delight, and eloquence of divine origin and inspiration: \"Precious tobacco flowers are / our adornment /... They are only lent to us on / earth.... The flowers intoxicate my heart, / sumptuous tobacco flowers open / their corolla; / I wander in the petals of those enchanting / flowers\" (<i>Romances de los Señores de la Nueva España</i>).</p><p>Thus, in each of the flowers on his body, Xochipilli expresses the complexity and infinite nuances embodied in a single deity, with his most earthly aspects to the most transcendent and divine.</p><p>Today tobacco smoked in a ritual context is present in various agricultural communities in Central Mexico in ceremonies for rain, both to petition it and to give thanks to it. There is also a growing interest in the tobacco plant on the part of contemporary landscape architects for ornamental purposes in gardens and planted fields, for the beauty of its flowers not to mention the intense fragrance of some tobacco varieties.</p>",

This species grows in deciduous forests and in temperate forests and they bloom at the end of the dry season, when the tree has lost its leaves.</p><p>Perhaps for the Mexicas its most noteworthy characteristics were its stamens or filaments, strongly evocative in its vivid scarlet hue of the hairs on the young maize, as Sahagún emphasizes: they are \"chili red, extending, radiating, spreading, like maize silk.\" It is highly significant that, without actually being related to the maize plant, the Mexicas had dubbed it \"jilote (corn) flower.\"</p><p>Francisco Hernández mentions the medicinal properties of the skin covering the plant’s root, as an antiseptic and analgesic for the mouth and as beneficial for the kidneys.</p><p>However, its significance resides in its status as <i>precious</i> flower appropriate for offerings, perhaps for its characteristic physiognomy, highly attractive for its suggestive color and shape in the Mexica symbolic universe. Hernández comments on other varieties of this plant extremely similar in form and properties, opening the array to different flowers, while also highlighting the formal particularities that united them into a single symbolic entity.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The <i>xiloxochitl</i> or \"jilote (corn) flower\" is one of the most paradigmatic flowers in Mexica art for its richness and recurrent depiction. Iconographically, it has deep roots in Mexica visual imagery; at times showing the flower itself, alluding to all its meanings and cosmogonic values; at others, specifically evoking the <i>xiloxochitl</i> and signs of its nature. It appears in ancient documents among the insignia of diverse deities and in other contexts, as well as in Mexica art, such as the Xochipilli sculpture, which denotes its broad, complex symbolic universe.</p><p>The eloquent place name of Xiloxochitlan in the <i>Codex Mendoza</i>, showing three of these flowers with their intense red color sprouting from a tree, provides the key and starting point for the next levels of its interpretation. Sahagún’s texts open the door to the universe of this flower’s profound meanings. Its presence at feast day celebrations in the Mexica ritual calendar as a sacred gift for the gods is exemplified in the description of the celebration of \"The Flowers Are Offered\" or <i>Tlaxochimaco</i> to honor Huitzilopochtli, the Mexica patron god, and all the gods; in it Sahagún states, \"two days before the feast, when flowers were sought, all scattered over the mountains, that every flower might be found,\" followed by a list of flowers, including the <i>xiloxochitl</i>, to string them together at dawn into thick, long garlands of a variety of flowers that \"were handled with esteem, and cared for with reverence.\" In this way, the flower, in all its splendor, varieties, forms, and colors, was sought, gathered, prepared, and offered as the people’s most precious gift to their gods.</p><p>Similarly, as part of a diverse and sacred whole, the <i>xiloxochitl</i> appears sprouting from the flowery tree, the symbol of the cosmic tree or <i>axis mundi</i> holding the eternal fruit of life and death in the <i>Codex Magliabecchi</i>.</p><p>Significantly, the <i>xiloxichitl</i> appears on both sides of the trunk as well as crowning it, as a butterfly sips from its stamens. On this point, Sahagún reveals that butterflies along with hummingbirds and other birds embody the souls of warriors who died in battle after spending four years in the House of the Sun, only to return to earth to sip the nectar of the <i>xiloxochitl</i> and other flowers also with long feathery scarlet filaments. This is illustrated in the <i>Códice Tudela</i>, where we can see a hummingbird sipping from the <i>xiloxochitl</i> flowers in the headdress worn by some deities.</p><p>All of this sheds light on the significance of the butterfly as a recurrent motif on the pedestal of the Xochipilli sculpture.</p><p>The <i>xiloxochitl</i> is also related to the deity group Macuilxochitl-Xochipilli, which encompasses a sweeping universe of flowers, music, games, poetry, enjoyment, and sensuality. In addition to dressing the god Macuilxochitl in a scene showing the <i>patolli</i> game in the <i>Códice Tudela</i>, the <i>xiloxochitl</i> appears as a flowery speech scroll from the mouth of one of the participants, symbolizing the words of a song.</p><p>In the Xochipilli sculpture, this flower fulfills both functions: representing the <i>xiloxochitl</i> as one of the most highly prized flowers in the Mexica floral universe through the attributes and evocations of its nature, and invoking the flower as a rich universal entity through its complex iconographic repertoire, in which this flower in particular was a favored icon.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The flower insignia covering the Xochipilli sculpture show floral designs, both as buds and open blossoms. Although at first sight they are immediately recognizable as flowers for the clarity and simplicity of their elements, they were not as identifiable in nature as a particular botanical species, given the generic or archetypal character of their depiction. Note the delicacy and richness of the Mexica carving, revealed in its greatest splendor through the Xochipilli from Tlalmanalco. Xochipilli is presented as the Lord of Flowers, of <i>all</i> flowers in their sweeping diversity and exuberance. On the one hand, variety is expressed through designs with differentiated iconographic features that suggest flowers with specific meanings and attributes. On the other, exuberance is suggested by numerous reiterated motifs, such as these flowers with archetypical characteristics on the sculpture as open flowers and in two types of buds.</p><p>The open flowers—with six petals on Xochipilli’s body and twelve petals on four sides of his pedestal—are all identical: rounded petals in a front and back row around a clear round center. In this style of representing the flower, identifiable on many other archaeological pieces and in Fray Bernardino de Sahagún’s <i>Primeros Memoriales</i>, the distinctive trait is the curled hook-shaped curve of the petals.</p><p>In the case of buds, one of them has the same sort of curled hook-shaped curve, although the petals are closed, which relates it to open flowers, as if it were its bud version; but at the same time, this distinctive drawing makes it an even more archetypal iconographic element, for the absence of any similarity with any botanical species, and because it maintains its semantics by clearly depicting a closed flower. In contrast, the other type of generic bud is much more organic and natural in its depiction, and the problem of identification it presents by suggesting a shoot of countless floral species.</p><p>However, in order to seek comparisons and answers in the Mexica floral universe and its natural context, we can link this iconographic complex to botanical species from the Asteraceae family (from aster: star), and more specifically to the genuses <i>Dahlia </i>(dahlias), <i>Bidens</i> (asters), and <i>Tithonia</i> (sunflowers).</p><p>The proliferation of these species in the Basin of Mexico and its surroundings and the predilection they have enjoyed to the present for their beauty and color come to mind as we contemplate this floral motif repeated on Xochipilli. It coincides with dahlia physiognomy in its star-like shape with petals emerging from a well-defined round center, and the particularity that the petals of these species tend to gather and bend as if shirred along the edges and especially at the base.</p><p>Dahlias grow naturally in oak forests from June to November, but they are also cultivated and can generally be obtained year round.</p><p>In the words of Francisco Hernández, \"there are many varieties of this ornamental plant distinguished only by color and size of the flowers, which in some cases are white, in others yellow, or purple, or red, white with purple, yellow with some reddish parts, and a thousand other ways; they are used in crowns, garlands, and bouquets.\"</p><p>In addition to their extensive ornamental use, dahlia roots are regarded as highly useful edible tubers, which are also good for treating chronic coughs.</p>",

			txt: "<p>As Hernández mentioned, the widespread use of this ornamental flower in making crowns, garlands, and bouquets situated it in the universe of flowers employed in ritual life and religious celebrations. According to Sahagún, the <i>acocoxochitl </i>heads the list of flowers that the people sought in fields and corn fields two days before the start of the celebration of the \"The Flowers Are Offered\" or <i>Tlaxochimaco</i>, when flowers were strung into long, thick garlands to be offered to Huitzilopochtli, the patron god, and to all the gods. In this ritual context the dahlia was regarded as a precious flower, worthy of being offered to the divinity.</p><p>However, beyond the botanical species with which it might be identified, this flower on Xochipilli is the most repeated type on the sculpture and on the four sides of the pedestal. Thus, this flower on Xochipilli’s body evokes the plurality of flowers and joins the rest of the species depicted on the sculpture as a sacred flower, each one with its specific attributes and qualities. On the pedestal, it is the predominant iconographic element that unites and harmonizes the lower and upper halves, which display opposite qualities. The lower part is completely geometric, while the upper part has undulating, organic lines triggering the interplay of harmonious iconographic dualities. Just as the underworld contrasts and complements the celestial world in Mexica worldview, the flower on this pedestal is rendered as a harmonizing element between dualities, the product of the union of elements of the land and elements of the sun—just as Xochipilli himself, the fruit of a solar god with an earth goddess. As a final touch, the flower is crowned by the butterfly, which in addition to evoking the souls of warriors who died in battle who fed the sun with their blood to generate all life on the earth, it is an entity of transition par excellence through the metamorphosis that awakens the nocturnal world of darkness and moisture that gives way to the daytime universe of life and sunlight.</p><p>As for the buds, while those in the more naturalistic rendering evoke the transformative phase of all flowers before they reach their ephemeral state of splendor, those of the more archetypical design refer us to another type of symbolic universe, above all when we identify them in other archaeological pieces specifically related to the Xochipilli-Macuilxochitl deity group. Macuilxochitl, \"five flower,\" is the god related to games and music and he shares the symbolic dimension of pleasure and festivity with Xochipilli. This same representation of the bud can also be found on two types of Mexica stone drum sculptures: a <i>teponaztli</i> or horizontal slit drum of the god Macuilxochitl and on a <i>huehuetl</i> or upright, vertical drum where these flowers are depicted in a row, alternating with a heart-shaped element, arranged over the base of the drum, which is decorated with a geometric design identical to the design on the base of Xochipilli’s pedestal. Although further work is needed for a greater understanding of these iconographic and symbolic relations, a preliminary exploration suggests the fundamental role of flowers in the context of music, pleasure, and celebrations. We also find them, in this same iconographic style, among the insignia of fertility deities; or as sprouts on the flowering tree, a representation of the <i>axis mundi</i>; or carved on a shell pouring precious water crowned by a <i>chalchihuite</i> or jade bead; or else on its own with stylized features as part of the marvelous sculptural production of Xochimilco, the region associated with flowers par excellence.</p><p>These days, dahlias are so well-known in contemporary culture in Mexico that they are regarded as the national flower. They are cultivated, offered, given as a gift, and employed for ornamental purposes in an ever greater range of colors and shapes, as a result of the genetic expansion of its varieties.</p><p>However, in their more universal meaning, flowers preserve their multifaceted and rich semantic dimensions, ranging from the sensual and earthly to the highest spiritual levels as a sign of social and religious offering.</p><p>These archetypal flowers on Xochipilli make us reflect on his role as Lord of <i>All</i> Flowers, in all of their diversity and exuberance. Although all the botanical species in the Mexica natural, symbolic, and ritual universe played irreplaceable roles given their character and attributes, flowers were fundamental cultural entities that permeated all levels of society and life, producing pleasure, solace, and delight, as an image of beauty, possessing curative and supernatural powers, while constituting a symbol of merit, a sacred gift, a metaphor of preciousness, and a sign of divinity.</p>",

Since time immemorial, it has been one of the most popular, emblematic, and representative flowers of Mexican culture. It is mentioned countless times in a number of accounts on the natural wealth of the New World in the sixteenth century. It is also described as the \"rose of the Indies\" or \"large carnation of the Indies,\" evocative terms appealing to the collective imagination of the Old World.</p><p>This flower grows naturally in temperate deciduous forests from the start of the rainy season to the harvest celebrations, culminating with the Day of the Dead. It is also related to the agricultural cycle and can be found in corn fields. From pre-Hispanic times to the present, it has been cultivated for different purposes: ornamental, medicinal, ritual, food for fowl, and for dyes.</p><p>Fray Bernardino de Sahagún describes them: \"they are yellow and have a pleasing odor and are beautiful, there are many of them . . . they are planted in all sorts of flower gardens,\" emphasizing the abundance of this species growing as wildflowers and their availability in household gardens and flower gardens, for their characteristic intense yellow color and distinctive pungent aroma. They were an essential part of the chromatic and spiritual palette of the natural landscape in the Basin of Mexico and its surroundings. Alvarado Tezozómoc, evoking a magnificent image of the ancient metropolis, tells that the <i>cempasuchil</i> was diligently cultivated beside corn fields on countless <i>chinampas</i> (artificially built fields in the lake) so that \"the great city of Mexico would blossom\" and from afar could be seen as \"a labyrinth, a delightful, joyous flower garden in blossom bringing happiness to the eye.\"</p><p>It also had numerous medicinal properties. In addition to identifying and describing seven varieties of this flower, Francisco Hernández explains, for example, its ability to produce sweating to cure fevers, arouse sexual desire, relax muscle cramps, soothe the stomach, and open block vessels.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The <i>cempoalxochitl</i>, which José Emilio Pacheco calls the \"Aztec flower,\" is one of the most flowers most frequently mentioned in old documents as a key part of both daily and ritual life. Its meaning takes on different depths and nuances as each reference to it is analyzed.</p><p>Its relationship to celebrations honoring the dead, so it is also known as \"flower of the dead,\" can be traced to antiquity, but the marigold is much more than that.</p><p>It was present in the complex context of Mexica ritual. According to Sahagún, at the feast and ceremonies of <i>Tecuilhuitontli,</i> \"Minor Feast of the Lords,\" as the flower carried by the common folk who attended the ceremonies; at <i>Uey Tecuilhuitl</i>, \"Great Feast of the Lords,\" through its aroma as an offering and source of delight, accompanying the first fruit of the harvest, adorning the heads of women before they were offered to Huitzilopochtli and as a prize in the race called Xochipaina; at <i>Tlaxochimaco</i>, \"The Flowers Are Offered,\" decorating garlands and in crowns; and at <i>Ochpaniztli</i>, \"The Sweeping of the Way,\" as projectiles in a ritual combat or \"stoning.\"</p><p>However, perhaps one of the most suggestive references comes from Sahagún’s mention of it in his description of <i>Tlalocan</i>, where the rain god Tlaloc reigned, one of the soul’s four destinations after death for those who died of causes related to water; \"good-hearted,\" beloved beings chosen by the gods to be taken with them to this place of delight, where nothing deteriorates and spring is eternal. \"And in Tlalocan all prospered greatly... Never did one suffer. Never was there a lack of ears of green maize, squash, squash blossoms, heads of amaranth, green chilis, tomatoes, green beans, nor the Tagetes flower.\" It is revealing how in this description of that place of eternal abundance of everything needed for life, it equates flowers with the fruit of corn fields, with foodstuffs; in this account the <i>cempoalxochitl</i> in itself represents all flowers, as well as the flower as a symbolic entity.</p><p>We might think it is a more naturalistic description of what tends to be found, until the present, in corn fields, but the reference to the <i>cempoalxochitl</i> in the Nahuatl version of the text points to a means of expression that responds to a particular worldview. According to the narrative thread, the <i>cempoalxochitl</i> is part of the image of abundance, fertility, and eternal spring held in the symbolic imagery of this sacred place, of life in all its splendor. The <i>Romances de los Señores de la Nueva España</i> declares: \"I offer, / here, I make it rain / flowers of spring, <i>cempasuchiles</i> (marigolds).\" Tlaloc, lord of water and fertility symbol, is called \"lord of the perfumed <i>cempoalxochitl</i>\" in the prayer dedicated to him.</p><p>Furthermore, we might speculate that references to certain flowers as <i>roses</i> in the historical chronicles, a term used generically for large fragrant flowers, especially if it is specified that they are yellow, as Durán does at times, might be the marigold. Although this is still a supposition, it is borne out by the profusion of marigolds everywhere, beyond the occasions mentioned here. Its symbolic and cultural power was such that it constantly permeated all realities.</p><p>This presence is also clearly expressed in Mexica art. Eloquent examples in the same line include beautiful and remarkably crafted effigy-braziers of fertility goddesses wearing strings of marigolds alternating with ears of corn or chilis. Marigolds accompanied by maize and other foodstuffs, all connected to the milpa (corn field) as a source of food and symbol of the sustenance upholding human life, both on earth and after death, in the beyond, as seen in Sahagún’s descriptions of <i>Tlalocan</i>, where marigolds are ever present, alongside chilies, squash, ears of corn, and tomatoes.</p><p>The marigold also appears on two colossal sculptures of the goddess Coyolxauhqui. The headdress crowning her head is an arrangement of features forming a great marigold flower, perhaps because the goddess is depicted after her death, after being decapitated and dismembered by her brother Huitzilopochtli on <i>Coatepec </i>hill.</p><p>The deep ancient roots have ensured the strength and enduring influence of marigolds in contemporary popular culture, not to mention ritual, especially in Day of the Dead celebrations. Its importance also persists in agricultural contexts, where it is still seen growing wild in the milpa. In fact, it has become one of the symbols of Mexican culture through its reiterated appearance in graphic, visual, decorative, and folk arts. It might be safe to say that it is part of the imagery defining Mexican identity.</p>",

It is one of the plants that has preserved many of its ancient meanings and uses in ritual, symbolic, medicinal, and modern-day medicinal contexts.</p><p>Its great adaptive quality enables it to grow wild in both hot and temperate climates and at a wide range of altitudes, mainly mountain forests, as well as on roadsides and near milpas (corn fields).

Among its many other useful properties, baths of these flowers were given to people who suffered from the \"divine disease,\" translated by Sahagún as leprosy. This relationship with water and its uses to treat ailments associated with it are curiously reiterated in the <i>Codex De la Cruz-Badiano</i>, when it is mentioned as a protective ingredient in preparations for \"whoever wishes to safely cross a river or water.\" Francisco Hernández attributes it with the power to \"relieve lunacy and those stunned by lightning,\" in addition to various other uses and medicinal benefits ranging from stopping headaches and flatulence, extracting bedbugs, and expelling kidney stones, even to producing abortions, provoking menstruation, and increasing milk production.</p><p>Today it is used in traditional medicine rituals by curers and it is among the indispensable herbs in the repertoire used by midwives for obstetric uses.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The countless medicinal uses and the distinctive and intense aroma of sweet-scented marigolds have earned it a unique place among the more popular traditional plants since time immemorial. However, the origin of its cultural roots can only be explained because it is immersed in the complex Mesoamerican symbolic world. The use of <i>yauhtli</i> for ritual purposes is extended from the north of Mexican territory today to Central America.</p><p>In the Mexica worldview, it had multiple meanings, and its flowers were ever present and essential in religious celebrations and ceremonies. Its participation in each ritual responded to cosmogonic implications that went beyond the purely ornamental and sensual. Consequently, the sweet-scented marigold stood apart from the rest of the flowers in its role as a symbol of offering to assume its own semantics. As an aromatic offering, alongside copal incense and other flowers, <i>yauhtli</i> also became food for the gods.</p><p>The ancient Mexicans regarded it as part of the sacred plants that had psychotropic powers, along with <i>ololiuhqui</i>, <i>toloache</i>, peyote, and the <i>nanacatl </i>mushroom. Sahagún states that the powder made from the <i>yauhtli</i> flower was blown in the face of captives in the celebration of <i>Xocotl uetzi</i>, \"The Fruit Falls,\" just before being cast into the fire \"that they might lose their sense of feeling and not suffer so greatly.\" Although contemporary studies have not found the chemical component underlying its psychoactive properties, in ritual contexts <i>yauhtli</i> flowers scattered, incensed, dried, in powder, or as incense, were ever-present at the most sacred times of close communication with the divine. Sahagún describes it as \"a sweet-smelling herb that they use to incense the idols,\" and mentions it in descriptions of various celebrations in the ritual calendar. However, the most significant point is the role of <i>yauhtli</i> in rituals related to deities of water and plant fertility evident in this account. Ground into a powder, it is kept as incense in pouches lavishly adorned with seashells for the celebration to honor Tlaloc, lord of water, and his consort Chalchiuhtlicue; its flowers were part of the insignia of women who personified the salt goddess, Uixtocihuatl, considered \"the elder sister of the rain gods\"<i>;</i> and it was solemnly sprinkled on the young woman dressed as Xilonen, the young maize goddess.</p><p>The reiteration in the narrative citing the use of <i>yauhtli</i> as incense and as a substance used to perform \"cleansings\" reminds us of the countless references to how it is thrown onto individuals who are to be sacrificed when they are invested as gods, personifying them, right before their ritual death, as if the <i>yauhtli</i> possessed the symbolic power to purify.</p><p>In addition to the description of religious celebrations, the relationship between <i>yauhtli</i> and deities of water and agricultural fertility is expressed in iconography, where these flowers are attached to staffs and headdresses as part of the gods’ insignia.</p><p>However, of all of the gods, <i>yauhtli</i> refers most clearly to Tlaloc. It evokes, symbolizes, and even personifies him. Sahagún tells how in his kingdom, in <i>Tlalocan</i>, Tlaloc is served with rubber and <i>yauhtli</i>. In some prayers addressed to him, he is invoked as \"lord of rubber, <i>yauhtli</i>, and copal (incense).\"</p><p>Today, the archaeological discovery of <i>yauhtli</i> seeds in offerings at the Templo Mayor (Great Temple) of Tenochtitlan further attests to the undeniable importance of this sacred plant of multiple meanings and complex value in Mexica life and thought.</p><p>Over the centuries, its close relationship with Tlaloc and veneration linked to him permitted <i>yauhtli</i> to come down to the present as an essential element in agrarian rituals conducted in rural communities in Mexico. Nowadays it is also commonly known in Spanish as <i>pericón</i>, which is used to protect corn fields from strong winds that threaten them during the ritual celebration of the first harvest called \"La periconeada\" held on September 28 in Central Mexico. Because they say \"the devil is on the loose,\" they place <i>yauhtli</i> flower crosses on homes, churches, streets, and cemeteries, and its symbolism and veneration merge with the figure of Saint Michael the Archangel, vanquisher of the devil and protector of harvests, whose sword <i>is</i> the aroma of sweet-scented marigold plant. Its smell is so powerful that in the fields of Morelos, dried <i>pericón</i> is burned on coals to produce fragrant smoke to ward off storms and hail, when thunder and lightning threaten crops.</p><p>From Mexica times to the present, <i>yauhtli</i> has been an essential element in Mexico’s symbolism.</p>",

			txt: "<p>\"The flowers of this tree are beautiful . . . they are shot with red, yellow and white, they have a gentle fragrance, and they comfort the heart with their scent. In these regions of Mexico these flowers are made,\" says Fray Bernardino de Sahagún to describe the <i>cacaloxochitl</i> or \"raven flower.\" Perhaps the ancient Nahuas gave it this name because there is a strange and highly prized variety of this flower that is black and iridescent, and its petals evoke the plumage of ravens. Today it is known as \"flor de mayo\" or May flower in Spanish, because the time of its greatest splendor is during this month, at the start of the rainy season, when verdure and exuberance are at their peak. Known as frangipani in English, it grows in temperate deciduous forests, in dry tropical environments. Besides growing wild, it was cultivated for its aromatic and ornamental value from the time of the ancient Mexicans. In gardens tended by \"officers of flowers\" in the Basin of Mexico, the <i>cacaloxochitl</i> was among the species imported from the \"hotlands\" or tropical zones. Their presence in these gardens marked them as a symbol of the wealth and power that encompassed faraway lands, which made the presence of these flowers possible. It is worth noting that Sahagún clarifies that \"those that come from hotlands are better\" and the variety of this tree that \"grows anywhere\" and \"is not scarce\" has no smell or value, highlighting the esteem for the tropical <i>cacaloxochitl</i> resided in its fragrance and exotic origin. Consequently, it was among the flowers preferred for making crowns, garlands, and bouquets.</p><p>It was also prized for its medicinal properties. Francisco Hernández tells that the pith of this plant \"cleans the stomach and intestines.\" However, the most interesting references are those from the <i>Codex De la Cruz-Badiano</i>, where it records that <i>cacaloxochitl</i> flowers are added to diverse mixtures to treat scaly skin on the cheeks, to cure fear, or to relieve \"the fatigue of he who manages the republic and holds a public office.\"</p><p>To the present, the frangipani continues to be a species prized for its beauty and fragrance. It is planted in gardens and cemeteries; in some regions of southeastern Mexico, it is consumed with chocolate to give it a touch of flavor and aroma, while in cuisine it is used as an edible and ornamental flower.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The <i>cacaloxochitl</i> in the Mexica world was considered one of the precious flowers reserved for lords and outstanding warriors, as status symbols and as an offering to the \"nobles\" and to the gods, either the flower itself or its fragrance.</p><p>Exuberant and opulent botanical gardens where they were cultivated were a display and deployment of the sovereign’s power. In them the <i>cacaloxochitl</i> was sought as an exotic and precious species, together with cacao and the \"heart flower.\" At the same time, it is mentioned as an ingredient in the remedy to cure the fatigue suffered by lords and officials as part of a long and specific list of plants, animals, and stones, all considered precious. It is repeatedly mentioned as an exquisite sumptuary object.</p><p>In ceremonial contexts, the <i>cacaloxochitl</i> was among the flowers collected and offered to the patron god Huitzilopochtli at the celebration of <i>Tlaxochimaco</i>, \"The Flowers Are Offered,\" and at the movable celebration of the day sign One Flint, but as different types of offerings. In T<i>laxochimaco</i> the frangipani was made into garlands to adorn streets and temples, together with other flowers, thus being a gift with ornamental value, as a decoration and precious object. It was also alternated with the <i>oceloxochitl</i> in garlands worn in dances. However, in the latter case, the <i>cacaloxochitl</i> was given and employed more as an aromatic offering as a flower with a \"very gentle smell\" which, together with tobacco smoke, completely filled the temple, as Sahagún describes. In this sense, because the essence of flowers was the preferred food of the gods, the fragrance of the <i>cacaloxochitl</i> was also sacred sustenance.</p><p>As a symbol associated with song and the elegant and flowery use of language, it is related to the deity group Xochipilli-Macuilxochitl. Thus, the <i>cacaloxochitl</i> is mentioned in the <i>Romances de los Señores de la Nueva España</i> as a metaphor of the divine provenance of the creative inspiration of the verses: \"Ah, if they could be taken / flowers and songs to his dwelling place! / If I could go adorned / with raven flowers embellished / with gold.\" However, the <i>Romances</i> also contrast the presence of <i>cacaloxochitl</i> as a metaphor of the earthy and carnal realm, appealing to a woman in a sexual context of sensuality, pleasure, and excess. In an almost erotic verse, the woman recites to the man: \"We are joined by raven flowers,... There, in our room, / flowers fill my heart with joy.\"</p><p>These paradoxes that hover between the realms of the sacred and the mundane show the complex symbolic nature of flowers. Today the frangipani continues to be a metaphor of beauty and pleasure in its ornamental character and in its use as a cosmetic. Its medicinal properties have been increasingly refined and studied; at the same time, it preserves its ritual and sacred dimensions in agricultural contexts, adorning the Holy Cross in ceremonies to petition rains and to give thanks for rain in Nahua communities.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The <i>huacalxochitl</i> or \"basket flower,\" today generically known as philodendrons, is actually a group of tiny flowers distributed on a spike surrounded by what seems to be a large petal, but that is actually a bract or protective leaf reminiscent of a woven fiber basket or a stick crate. This similar is what gives it its name in Nahuatl.</p><p>Its specific identification has led to confusion as a result of the large number of varieties and the fact that the plant commonly known today in Mexico as the calla lily is a species of African origin. Nevertheless, since ancient Mexican times, various species of the same botanical family have existed in the Americas. Their distinctive physiognomy earned them the name of <i>huacalxochitl</i>.</p><p>These plants tend to grow in tropical climates, in diverse habitats, but they are also cultivated. In pre-Hispanic times they were brought to Central Mexico from tropical hotlands, together with other plants considered exotic, such as the cacao and the <i>yolloxochitl</i>, \"heart flower,\" to be planted in groves and gardens in Tenochtitlan and its environs. According to chronicler Alvarado Tezozómoc, these plants were brought from afar with their roots to be transplanted in Oaxtepec, where the largest and most exuberant botanical garden of the time and one of the first in the world was created.</p><p>Fray Bernardino de Sahagún describes the <i>huacalxochitl</i> as a creeper with a \"thick-skinned\" flower and a round, pointed, resinous center. He also refers to many varieties, some aromatic, and others scentless. Of them, he highlights the red <i>huacalxochitl</i> as something \"precious, something that can be deserved for merit; something that can be appropriated,\" which was perhaps the most highly prized variety of all. It is the most frequently depicted in ancient documents and sources refer to it when the term <i>huacalxochitl </i>is used generically. Francisco Hernández defines it as \"foreign,\" reminding us that it was imported and he emphasizes the scarlet color of its outer sheath</p><p>Its aromatic properties, enhanced when the flower was placed in water, augmented appreciation for it. Along with vanilla, mushrooms, and other flowers and herbs, it was part of the mixture rubbed on tobacco with for its preparation.</p><p>It also had many medicinal uses. According to the <i>Codex De la Cruz-Badiano</i>, which contains one of the most beautiful representations of it, it was used to treat burning eyes, infected tonsils, chest pain, and was among the precious flowers that relieved \"the fatigue of those who governed the republic and served in public office,\" when squeezed into spring water.</p><p>Today numerous varieties of this plant are cultivated for ornamental purposes, for outdoor gardens and for interiors.</p>",

			txt: "<p>To fully understand the meanings and symbolism of the <i>huacalxochitl</i> is a major challenge, given that references to it are dispersed, unclear, and at times enigmatic. Nonetheless, it is represented repeatedly with great artistry and in a prominent position, playing a preponderant role in the everyday, ritual, and symbolic universe of the Mexicas. At the same time, it prompts many questions, because its symbolism almost always remains hidden. The diversity of contexts in which it appears, at times contradictory or apparently unconnected, exposes semantics full of complexity and hidden dimensions.</p><p>Beginning with what is clearly known, this flower is related to others widely known in the Mexica ritual world as one of the \"precious flowers, sweet-smelling and fragrant\" offered to Huitzilopochtli on his day sign, One Flint, during movable celebrations in the ritual calendar.</p><p>This condition as flower reserved for the nobility can be explained in part by its aromatic quality, as in the case of other plants such as cacao and magnolias, for its \"foreign\" and exotic status, which earned it a special place among species cultivated in Mexica gardens, which were canvases to express the magnificence of power, pleasure, enjoyment, and fascination with botanical knowledge.</p><p>Consequently, <i>huacalxochitl</i> as a symbol of privilege and distinction was also among the motifs that adorned the lavish attire of the nobility, who wore fine cotton mantles decorated with flower patterns. Merchants, who also belonged to a privileged class who had their own specialized rituals, surely flaunted it, not to mention those individuals responsible for bringing it from faraway places to centers of power. The latter obtained and supplied these flowers, and in some way they possessed them before they reached their final destination.</p><p>Consequently, it was also a good in transit, brought almost as a trophy from far away. And perhaps that is why it also became a sort of focus as an omen or amulet. Francisco Hernández refers to this when he mentions merchants who carried the fruit of this plant on their head \"as if a crest... hoping to secure greater profits.\" Similarly, hunters did the same to ensure more and better prey.</p><p>It is also interesting how, amidst sophisticated medical prescriptions, Martín de la Cruz includes it in his instructions on \"Help for the traveler,\" appealing to all those who, as merchants and hunters, regularly faced the dangers and uncertainty of unknown paths. It involved making a complex powdered mixture placed \"in the hollow of the well-known, very sweet-smelling flower, <i>huacalxochitl,</i>\" to produce \"a little vessel that was suspended from the neck\" to take on journeys.</p><p>Also Sahagún makes a peculiar reference to a variety of this flower when he speaks of the <i>teccizuacalxochitl</i> or <i>huacalxochitl</i>-shell as a flower required when the \"women of the palace claimed it as what they merited—those considered as secluded, those who were Motecuhzoma’s women: wherefore, they say, they were carnally guilty.\" Hernández, referring to the same species with the name <i>telaxincaxochitl</i> or \"adultery flower,\" describes how Motecuhzoma’s innumerable concubines sought sexual pleasure with this flower \"given the lack of men.\"</p><p>These references and the relationship of philodendrons with monkeys, an animal associated with playfulness, carnal desire, sexual pleasure, and Xochipilli, reveal another dimension of the symbolic universe surrounding this flower. It is shown held by a monkey in various archaeological pieces. Besides sharing a proclivity for climbing trees, the philodendron and monkey embody the idea of sensual pleasure and lust.</p><p>However, this is not its only relationship with enjoyment and joy. The <i>huacalxochitl</i> also evokes the world of song, music, and dance. We can see it exquisitely carved on a <i>teponaztli</i> or wood slit drum from Tlaxcala held by a richly attired warrior forming the body of the drum. In fact, Hernández tells us that these flowers \"were highly esteemed by the Indians, and they were offered in bouquets to heroes and to those they called <i>tlatoani</i> [the ruler] because they were the only ones allowed to speak at assemblies.\" We should bear in mind that eloquence and discourse in the Nahuatl world were interwoven and often they were synonymous with \"song.\" Rhetoric was the way of speaking \"<i>in xochitl in cuicatl,</i>\" \"in flower and song,\" in other words with eloquence. And in this regard, the most eloquent sources are pictorial references, where the red <i>huacalxochitl</i> is rendered in detail and is shown playing a prominent role in scenes of song, music, and dance, part of the paraphernalia that accompanied the insignia and instruments played in rituals prior to warfare. Alongside these emblems of flowers and feathers held as staffs, they are also represented in scenes of offering and are displayed as part of the group of sumptuary objects in the book on merchants in the <i>Florentine Codex</i>.</p><p>Nowadays it might seem that all these intricate symbolic meanings have remained hidden, or perhaps lost, and instead for the diverse varieties of <i>huacalxochitl</i> in contemporary culture<i>,</i> the flower has been primarily reduced to an ornamental purpose. However, its ongoing appeal as a species highly valued in horticulture is undeniable, as well as the key role it plays as one of the flowers that in one way or another evokes Mexican identity.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The <i>oceloxochitl</i> occupied a special place in the Mexica symbolic universe for its coloring, which linked it to one of their most representative and most sacred emblems: the jaguar. Thus we see it in the colorful depiction of mantles worn at religious celebrations in the <i>Codex Magliabecchi</i> in the cloak with the <i>ocelotl</i> or jaguar motif, which upon closer examination of its spots, we can distinguish them as <i>oceloxochitl </i>flowers with their triad of petals and spotted center.</p><p>Sahagún observes that in the Mexica ceremonial universe the <i>oceloxochitl</i> was one of the many flowers \"both wild and rural\" that the common people collected in fields, mountains, and in corn fields two days before the start of the feast of the \"The Flowers Are Offered\" or Tlaxochimaco, to string them into garlands and \"when they had been threaded, [then] they were twisted and wound [in garlands]—long [ones], very long, and thick—very thick.\"</p><p>However, the <i>oceloxochitl</i> played a special role in this celebration, as show in the <i>Codex Borbonicus</i>, one of the oldest pictorial documents from Central Mexico. In colorful and eloquent images, the <i>oceloxochitl</i> can be seen alternating with the \"raven flower\" or <i>cacaloxochitl</i>, forming these lavish garlands.</p><p>Not only was it used in this celebration, but the ancient Mexicans probably made use of the flowers on countless occasions to dress up and make offerings to their gods. As Hernández tells us the <i>oceloxochitl</i> \"is used, for the beauty of its flowers, in crowns and bouquets,\" which are normally made for religious celebrations.</p><p>The jaguar is also a symbol of the warrior, and in this sense, because the flower and its diverse species were one of the favored metaphors in poetry to reveal distinct symbolic entities, the presence of the <i>oceloxochitl</i> in songs and \"flowery language\" of fine Nahuatl rhetoric is crystalized in the idea of the warrior. The <i>Cantares mexicanos</i> alludes to it to portray the warrior and warfare as sublime entities: \"Ah, flowers will never tire of war! /... They are on the edge of the water: / jaguar flowers and shield flowers / open their corolla, they join together / in the place of the campanillas (little bells; bell flowers; campanulas), the place of powder. / The jaguar flowers perfumed of cacao / are found there, in the place of the scattering, / in the midst of the plain. / They exhale their fragrance over us. / Who then does not desire them? / They are glory and pride!\"</p><p>Today the relationship of the tiger flower and jaguar might to simply reside in the allusion to the distinctive markings of its pelt; however, the name distorts its essence by using the term <i>tiger</i>, which has striped instead of spotted skin. Nevertheless, today the jaguar remains one of the most evocative symbols from the past and the pre-Hispanic worldview. Although it may be hidden, the power of this symbolism, which once related it to one of the mightiest beings in the Mexica collective imagination, may persist in the continued preference for the <i>oceloxochitl</i> as an ornamental flower.</p>",

The variety endemic in southern Mexico was extremely valued by the ancient Mexicans, who devoutly cultivated it and took it to other zones of the territory, such as to the capital city of Tenochtitlan and its surroundings, to exuberant botanical gardens planted as a symbol of power and evocation of Tlalocan or \"earthly paradise.\" The flowers were so highly esteemed in the pre-Hispanic world, the magnolia and its attributes occupied a primordial place among the most highly prized flowers, even as an amulet, according to instructions recorded by Martín de la Cruz to make the \"little vessel hung from the neck,\" together with the <i>huacalxochitl,</i> as an \"aid for the traveler.\"</p><p>\"Noblemen and craftsmen use them,\" notes Sahagún, referring to their status as an exquisite sumptuary object reserved for privileged hands and contexts. An example of this is the consumption of pure cacao, a laborious commodity that when concentrated had a bitter taste that had to be softened with fragrant flowers that were also treasured. This beverage, <i>xochicacauatl</i> or \"flowering cacao,\" combined two symbols of power, wealth, and divinity: cacao and precious flowers, such as magnolias.</p><p>Its intense scent was in itself an offering for the gods, as the purest and most fragrant essences were their favorite food. Thus, in ritual contexts and Mexica feast days, the <i>yolloxochitl</i> was part of the flowers that the people devoutly collected to craft garlands and to crown the heads of their gods in the celebration of \"The Flowers Are Offered\" or Tlaxochimaco, in honor of their patron god Huitzilopochtli. Also, as a movable celebration on the day sign \"One Flint,\" dedicated to the same god, it is mentioned among the \"varied flowers, which were sweet-smelling and fragrant\" that were offered by Motecuhzoma the great <i>tlatoani </i>or emperor, set out in careful arrangements \"made as shields of flowers, circular,\" whose perfume \"spread and blanketed his temple\" along with tobacco smoke.</p><p>Therefore, it is of great importance that the maximum expression of the sublime attributes of this flower are also referred to in Book 12 of the <i>Florentine Codex</i>, where Sahagún tells of the conquest of Mexico, in one of the culminating moments of his narrative that was key for Mexican history: the meeting of Hernán Cortés and Motecuhzoma. Faced with the uncertainty and perplexity stirred by the feared encounter with the unknown, Motecuhzoma was adorned in his most lavish attire and he offered Cortés luxurious bowls containing these same round floral arrangements, the most exquisite, aromatic, and esteemed of those boasted and prized in the empire which included magnolias, along with sunflowers, tobacco, cacao blossoms, and popcorn flowers.</p><p>In the realm of rhetoric, songs, hymns, and \"flowery language,\" the <i>yolloxochitl</i> appeared in contexts with cacao, perfumed with its flowers, the <i>cacauaxochitl </i>or cacao blossoms. In this way, both were combined in the sacred beverage and in verses conjuring the metaphor for the sacrificed warrior, who just as the flower, after forming buds and blossoming, was exposed and gave up his heart to fulfill the vital cycle demanded by the Sun. The magnolia as the \"heart flower\" was not only white, the color that covered sacrificial victims, but also in verses it became a symbol of the warrior’s heart offered to feed the Sun, who in turn, granted him transcendence after death by allowing him to dwell in the House of the Sun as a bird or butterfly that would sip nectar from magnolia blossoms. The <i>Cantares mexicanos</i> intone: \"In the place of the red darts, / in the place of the red shields, / there in Tenochtitlan, / endure the cacao flower and the heart flower. / The flowers of the Giver of Life open their corollas. / Princes are savored / in the precinct of waters.\"</p><p>All this symbolism embodied in the magnolia has remained in its essence, in history, and in the collective memory. What will never come to an end is the awe and admiration triggered by is beauty, grandeur, and fragrance. The <i>yolloxochitl</i> continues to delight, blooming on trees adorning gardens, streets, and patios, providing shade to coffee and cacao trees. In cosmetics and perfumery its aroma is extracted in essences as it remains one of the most distinctive, exquisite and seductive of scents.</p>",

It did not go unnoticed by scholars of New World flora as a species native to the region, previously unknown to them. They compared it to jasmines, orange blossoms, and lilies as a result of its intense and exquisite fragrance.</p><p>This plant, a relative of the agave, is originally from central and southern Mexico and it grows in temperate moist climates.</p><p>The wild species of this plant is almost extinct, but today it is widely cultivated. It reproduces via bulbs generally planted in the spring and that bloom at the end of summer, sometimes until the beginning of winter; although it can blossom almost year round under controlled moisture and temperature conditions in greenhouses.</p><p>The plant grown in soil sprouts a slender stalk from which emerge white flowers in pairs forming bunches from their base and to the tip. These flowers are so fragrant that a single stalk can perfume a room for up to seven days.</p><p>It is popularly known as tuberose, \"vara de San José\" or St. Joseph’s staff—based on its similarity to the iconography of this saint who traditionally holds a staff of white blossoms—or <i>amole</i>, a Nahuatl term (from <i>amolli</i>, soap) referring to its use as a source of soap, just as various agaves.</p><p>As for its medicinal uses, Francisco Hernández says the useful part of the plant is the root, whether applied or consumed, used to treat tumors and fever.</p><p>Nowadays it is primarily ornamental, although it is also employed for its fragrance, whose essence is extracted to make perfumes.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The symbolism surrounding the <i>omixochitl</i> or tuberose for the ancient Mexicans still remains partially obscure given the paucity of references to this flower in the chronicles, in contrast to other species much more frequently mentioned. Clearly it must have been highly valued given its intense and seductive fragrance. In the Nahuatl text of Sahagún’s <i>Florentine Codex</i>, it is described as \"fragrant, perfumed. It is pleasing to the soul, satisfying,\" and a few paragraphs later, \"It is of pleasing odor, fragrant, sweet; a precious thing, useful.\" These words confirm the predilection that the Nahuas of the time must have had for the <i>omixochitl</i>. In addition, Francisco Hernández reports, \"The flowers are used in bouquets and perfumes.\"</p><p>However, despite its intense aroma, it is not mentioned in descriptions of celebrations in the ritual calendar or in other ceremonies. Perhaps its wild local origin detracted from any potential prestige, because the Mexicas generally prized \"foreign\" flowers from the hotlands much more than local species. However, although the reasons for the scarcity of references to it remain unclear, the <i>omixochitl</i> or tuberose was probably the focus of ceremonies of communication with the gods through its powerful perfume, for the gods’ favorite food were aromas and the intense fragrance of flowers was believed to promote trance states and conversation with supernaturals.</p><p>A clear reference to the tuberose, albeit curious and different from that to all other flowers, in Sahagún comes from what he calls \"omens\" and \"superstitions\" in Book 5 of the <i>Florentine Codex</i>. The <i>omixochitl</i> was identified as the cause of ailments described in Spanish, \"in the lower parts of men and women; and ancient superstitions say that the disease is caused from having smelled this flower a lot... perhaps one had urinated or stepped on it.\" In the case of men the very appearance of the flower evoked illness, which was known by the same name as the flower. Interestingly, overindulgence in smelling the <i>omixochitl</i> as a cause of illness suggests a sort of punishment for unbridled pleasure-seeking through its aroma.</p><p>For the tuberose’s carnal and sensual dimension, it was associated with deities related to pleasure and flowers, such as Xochipilli, for one of its symbolic dimensions included sexual pleasure. Because the <i>omixochitl</i> was believed to cause these ailments, Xochipilli was the deity responsible for punishing transgressors who violated the sexual abstinence required by ceremonies and rituals.</p><p>Today the <i>omixochitl</i> is one of the most representative flowers in the universe of popular Mexican flowers. It is extensively cultivated to be used as cut flowers and as an ornamental species for its aroma. Until recently, it was related in popular tradition to funerals for its white color, but also for its potent perfume, useful for masking the smell of the corpse during wakes lasting several days.</p>",

			txt: "<p>The Devil’s hand tree flower comes from an eponymous tree that grows in the cloud forests and temperate evergreen forests of Mexico and Guatemala. It grows in high altitude zones at more than 2,500 meters above sea level.</p><p>Its name comes from the curious physiognomy of its flowers, which have five structures in the shape of fingers, which as a whole resemble an open hand with long, slender fingers \"scarlet in color on the inside and yellow with red on the outside,\" as Francisco Hernández describes it. It blooms at the end of spring into the early summer.</p><p>It must not have been a common or everyday occurrence to find a <i>macpalxochitl</i> specimen at the time of the ancient Mexicans, because this tree grows outside the Basin of Mexico and at high altitudes, not to mention it is extremely difficult to transplant. Those who study New World flora and who write of it in post-conquest botanical treatises made numerous unsuccessful attempts to transplant this tree in other gardens in and beyond the Americas, because they were captivated by its unique and distinctive features. The only reported case of a successful transplant was in the viceroy’s palace in Mexico City in the nineteenth century.</p><p>However, an interesting bit of information appears in the sole brief reference made to it in all of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún’s vast work. In the section on \"groves and trees that grow there\" the <i>macpalxochitl</i> is listed as one of the trees planted in it: \"There are also some trees in groves that are called <i>macpilsuchitl</i> where there are flowers that are like a hand with its fingers,\" which confirms its existence in the exuberant gardens planted at the behest of the <i>tlatoanis</i> or emperors. This speaks of the high regard in which this tree was held, of the prodigious abilities of the \"officers of flowers\" of the time, and that most probably, it was not widely used by the general population.</p><p>Perhaps this is why Hernández does not report on medicinal uses for this flower. In all likelihood it was not amply studied given the scarcity of this plant in the Basin of Mexico and the difficulty in reproducing it, although it was probably marginally used for medicinal purposes by the few who were able to get it.</p><p>The source that indeed refers to its medicinal uses is Martín de la Cruz in the <i>Codex De la Cruz-Badiano</i>. He mentions the ground up bark and leaves of the tree as part of the ingredients for an unguent to \"cure the pubic region\" in case of pain and tumors.</p><p>Nowadays <i>macpalxochitl</i> flowers are more commonly used for medicinal purposes. Its multiple properties have been studied and applied in traditional medicine and it is frequently used to treat patients with ailments related to the heart, nerves, and epilepsy. Its flowers, prepared as a tea regulate arterial pressure, sooth the nerves, alleviate insomnia, and mitigate dizziness. For the scientific community, unraveling the properties of this flower has been of special interest, which explains its ongoing study.</p><p>In indigenous communities its leaves are used to wrap tamales made for special occasions.</p>",

Given its rarity and distinctive features, it would have made a worthy gift brought by a <i>pochteca</i> or merchant to a ruler or nobleman in Central Mexico, and this could have started its fame and the initiative to cultivate it.</p><p>Nowadays it is more common in the region of Central Mexico. During its flowering season, Devil’s hand tree flowers are sold in markets to be employed in traditional medicine. The <i>macpalxochitl</i> has continued to occupy a special place in the popular collective memory as a representative Mexican flower, perhaps for the originality of its form or for its well-known medicinal boons, or perhaps simply for its remarkable appearance.</p>",
